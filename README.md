# PowerShell-Timer v0.1
A simple timer for Windows PowerShell

## Initial Notes
> - Timer works in-terminal.
> - Default time is 30 minutes.
> - No notification or system sound support.
> - May use some 'flavorful' language. Probably tone that down for full release.

## Development Roadmap
> 1. Notification & Sound support
> 2. Customizable Time
> 3. Support for alternating times (1h/30m default)
> 4. Support for IFTTT
> 5. Reformat Interface
